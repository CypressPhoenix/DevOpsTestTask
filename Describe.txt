I chose official docker image in this task from Docker Hub
This Docker config work in docker Swarm but i think use K8s is better chose, because Swarm is not supported from Docker inc
Log from NGINX saved in dir logs/nginx/

About Theoretical Part:
For start we configure Amazon Route 53 for control traffic and our DNS.
For firewall, use AWS Web application firewall for filter web traffic from client. For DDOS protection use AWS Shield.
To connection to network use NAT Gateway in Public subnet. In app, we use 2 different subnet for back-end and front-end for enhanced security.
All traffic goes from Elastic Load Balancer. And if under high load for 1 server auto-scaling create more front-end EC2 instance. At the same we use for back-end.
And for high availability we scale in other availability zone.
We can use RDS because this is very user-friendly. RDS we replicate for higher availability.
And all of this we Back up in S3 bucket.
